    "Linear Algebra is a mathematical discipline that deals with vectors and matrices and, more generally, with vector spaces and linear transformations. It is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as:\n",

    "The **physics student** perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space. What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing.  \n",
    "The **computer science perspective** is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.  \n",
    "The **mathematician**, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views, basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number,"
